The basis of this project was to build a chat bot in Python and SQL that talks to the
user about their favourite movies and genres. Through conversation the bot will
glean their preferences and using collaborative filtering techniques with a movie
database recommend movies for them to watch in the future. Itâ€™s conclusions were
that although language processing for computers can be difficult and frustrating for
the user to interact with, if you keep the subject matter constrained and
conversation guided it can be an effective way for the user to get information and
enjoy themselves.
